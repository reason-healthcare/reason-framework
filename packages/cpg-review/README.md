# CPG Preview Tool

This project renders a flow diagram dynamically based on desired CPG FHIR plan definition.

## Local Development

Ensure environment variables are set to a local FHIR implementation guide in order to resolve content. Specify a plan definition canonical as well. See `.env.example`

Then, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
